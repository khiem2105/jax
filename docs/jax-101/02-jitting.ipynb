        "Importantly, note how the jaxpr does not capture the side-effect of the function: there is nothing in it corresponding to `global_list.append(x)`. This is a feature, not a bug: JAX is designed to understand side-effect-free (a.k.a. functionally pure) code. If *pure function* and *side-effect* are unfamiliar terms, this is explained in a little more detail in [ðŸ”ª JAX - The Sharp Bits ðŸ”ª: Pure Functions](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#pure-functions).\n",

However, as a rule of thumb, you can expect (but shouldn't rely on) the side-effects of a JAX-transformed function to run once (during the first call), and never again. This is because of the way that JAX generates jaxpr, using a process called 'tracing'.\n",
        "\n",
        "When tracing, JAX wraps each argument by a *tracer* object. These tracers then record all JAX operations performed on them during the function call (which happens in regular Python). Then, JAX uses the tracer records to reconstruct the entire function. The output of that reconstruction is the jaxpr. Since the tracers do not record the Python side-effects, they do not appear in the jaxpr. However, the side-effects still happen during the trace itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: the Python `print()` function is not pure: the text output is a side-effect of the function. Therefore, any `print()` calls will only happen during tracing, and will not appear in the jaxpr:"

Another is to use special [control flow operators](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.lax.html#control-flow-operators) like `jax.lax.cond`. However, sometimes that is impossible. In that case, you can consider jitting only part of the function. For example, if the most computationally expensive part of the function is inside the loop, we can JIT just that inner part (though make sure to check the next section on caching to avoid shooting yourself in the foot):"
